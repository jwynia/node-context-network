# Software Project Context Network

## Location
The context network for this project is located at: ./context-network/

## Purpose
This context network contains all planning documents, architecture decisions, design discussions, and team coordination information for software development projects. It serves as a template for starting new software projects with built-in LLM management and navigation capabilities.

## Usage Guidelines
- ALL planning documents, architecture diagrams, and design discussions MUST be stored within the context network
- Do NOT place planning or architecture documents in the project root
- Project files outside the context network should only be files consumed by build systems, deployment tools, or end users
- Code, configuration, and implementation files belong in the project artifact domain, not in the context network

## Navigation
See the context network's navigation guide at ./context-network/discovery.md
