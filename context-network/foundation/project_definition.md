### Project Overview

The Node-TypeScript Context Network is a specialized template for starting new Node.js TypeScript projects with built-in LLM management and navigation capabilities. It provides a structured approach to managing the complex web of decisions, designs, and domain knowledge that underlies Node-TypeScript development, while maintaining a clear separation between planning artifacts (context network) and implementation code (app/ directory).

### Vision Statement

To transform Node-TypeScript development by creating a seamless bridge between human developers, AI agents, and project knowledge, enabling teams to navigate the rapidly evolving Node.js ecosystem and build more maintainable, comprehensible, and evolvable TypeScript applications.

### Mission Statement

The Node-TypeScript Context Network template provides development teams with a structured knowledge management system that captures the "why" behind Node-TypeScript decisions, preserves institutional knowledge about framework choices and configurations, facilitates onboarding to complex Node.js projects, and enables AI-assisted development through clear separation of planning and implementation artifacts.

### Project Objectives

1. Provide a specialized context network structure optimized for Node.js TypeScript projects
2. Establish clear patterns for documenting Node-TypeScript architecture decisions, framework selections, and configuration choices
3. Create navigation paths tailored to Node.js development roles and TypeScript-specific tasks
4. Enable effective collaboration between human developers and AI agents in the Node.js ecosystem
5. Reduce knowledge silos around framework choices, build configurations, and TypeScript patterns
6. Document decision-making processes for the rapidly evolving Node.js ecosystem
7. Preserve institutional knowledge about TypeScript configuration and tooling choices

### Success Criteria

1. Reduced time to first meaningful contribution for new developers
2. Decreased frequency of "archaeology" requests (digging for lost knowledge)
3. Improved documentation coverage of major components
4. Higher decision traceability percentage
5. Increased documentation update frequency relative to code changes
6. Greater developer confidence in making changes
7. Better stakeholder understanding of system state
8. Reduction in repeated mistakes

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Context network structure specialized for Node.js TypeScript development
- Templates for Node-TypeScript architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Node.js component and module documentation patterns
- TypeScript-specific process documentation templates
- Node.js ecosystem technical debt tracking mechanisms
- Navigation guides for Node.js development roles and TypeScript workflows
- Integration patterns with Node.js project structures and package.json
- Maintenance strategies for keeping documentation in sync with TypeScript code
- Framework selection decision templates (Express, Fastify, Next.js, etc.)
- TypeScript configuration and build tool decision frameworks
- Node.js deployment and environment configuration guidance
- Package management and dependency strategy documentation

#### Out of Scope

- Actual Node.js/TypeScript implementation code (belongs in app/ directory)
- Specific framework boilerplate or starter code
- Pre-configured build systems or bundlers
- Specific testing framework implementations
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline configurations
- Specific project management methodologies
- Package.json files or node_modules (belongs in app/ directory)

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Node.js Developers | Use the context network alongside TypeScript development | Node.js development teams |
| TypeScript Architects | Document Node-TypeScript architectural decisions and system design | Node.js architecture teams |
| Technical Leads | Ensure alignment between context network and Node.js implementation | Node.js team leads |
| New Team Members | Learn about the Node.js project through the context network | Onboarding Node.js developers |
| AI Agents | Navigate and update the context network based on Node-TypeScript interactions | LLM assistants with Node.js knowledge |
| DevOps Engineers | Reference deployment and environment configuration decisions | Infrastructure teams |

### Timeline

This is a template project without specific timeline milestones. Each Node-TypeScript implementation will have its own timeline.

### Constraints

- Must work with existing LLM agent capabilities and limitations
- Should be compatible with standard version control systems (Git)
- Must be Node.js and TypeScript ecosystem focused
- Should not require specialized tools beyond text editors, LLM agents, and Node.js tooling
- Must maintain separation between context network and app/ directory
- Should work with common Node.js development environments

### Assumptions

- Development teams will maintain discipline in separating planning from implementation artifacts
- LLM agents will have sufficient context window to process relevant parts of the network
- Teams will regularly update the context network alongside code changes
- The context network will be stored in the same repository as the code or in a linked repository

### Risks

- Context network may become outdated if not maintained alongside code
- Teams may struggle with the discipline of separating planning from implementation
- LLM context limitations may restrict the ability to process the entire network
- Over-documentation could slow down development velocity
- Under-documentation could reduce the value of the context network
