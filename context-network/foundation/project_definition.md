### Project Overview

The Software Project Context Network is a specialized template for starting new software development projects with built-in LLM management and navigation capabilities. It provides a structured approach to managing the complex web of decisions, designs, and domain knowledge that underlies every software project, while maintaining a clear separation between planning artifacts and implementation code.

### Vision Statement

To transform software development by creating a seamless bridge between human developers, AI agents, and project knowledge, enabling teams to build more maintainable, comprehensible, and evolvable software systems.

### Mission Statement

The Software Project Context Network template provides development teams with a structured knowledge management system that captures the "why" behind software decisions, preserves institutional knowledge, facilitates onboarding, and enables AI-assisted development through clear separation of planning and implementation artifacts.

### Project Objectives

1. Provide a specialized context network structure optimized for software development projects
2. Establish clear patterns for documenting architecture decisions, component designs, and technical processes
3. Create navigation paths tailored to different software development roles and tasks
4. Enable effective collaboration between human developers and AI agents
5. Reduce knowledge silos and prevent the loss of critical project context

### Success Criteria

1. Reduced time to first meaningful contribution for new developers
2. Decreased frequency of "archaeology" requests (digging for lost knowledge)
3. Improved documentation coverage of major components
4. Higher decision traceability percentage
5. Increased documentation update frequency relative to code changes
6. Greater developer confidence in making changes
7. Better stakeholder understanding of system state
8. Reduction in repeated mistakes

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Context network structure specialized for software development
- Templates for architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Component documentation patterns
- Process documentation templates
- Technical debt tracking mechanisms
- Navigation guides for different software development roles
- Integration patterns with code repositories
- Maintenance strategies for keeping documentation in sync with code

#### Out of Scope

- Specific programming language or framework implementations
- Actual software code or build systems
- Deployment configurations
- Testing frameworks
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Specific project management methodologies

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Software Developers | Use the context network alongside code development | Development teams |
| Software Architects | Document architectural decisions and system design | Architecture teams |
| Technical Leads | Ensure alignment between context network and implementation | Team leads |
| New Team Members | Learn about the project through the context network | Onboarding developers |
| AI Agents | Navigate and update the context network based on interactions | LLM assistants |

### Timeline

This is a template project without specific timeline milestones. Each implementation will have its own timeline.

### Constraints

- Must work with existing LLM agent capabilities and limitations
- Should be compatible with standard version control systems
- Must be language and framework agnostic
- Should not require specialized tools beyond text editors and LLM agents

### Assumptions

- Development teams will maintain discipline in separating planning from implementation artifacts
- LLM agents will have sufficient context window to process relevant parts of the network
- Teams will regularly update the context network alongside code changes
- The context network will be stored in the same repository as the code or in a linked repository

### Risks

- Context network may become outdated if not maintained alongside code
- Teams may struggle with the discipline of separating planning from implementation
- LLM context limitations may restrict the ability to process the entire network
- Over-documentation could slow down development velocity
- Under-documentation could reduce the value of the context network
