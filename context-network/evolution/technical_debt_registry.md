### What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or expedient solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Like financial debt, technical debt incurs "interest" in the form of extra effort needed in future development.

This registry tracks known technical debt items to ensure they are:
- Explicitly documented rather than implicit
- Assessed for their impact
- Prioritized appropriately
- Addressed according to a plan

### How to Use This Registry

This registry organizes technical debt items in multiple ways to help you find relevant information:

1. **By Priority**: Find the most critical debt items to address
2. **By Area**: Find debt related to specific areas of the system
3. **By Type**: Find specific types of technical debt
4. **By Impact**: Find debt based on what aspects of the system it affects

### Recording New Technical Debt

To record a new technical debt item:

1. Copy the template from `meta/templates/technical_debt_template.md`
2. Name the file `td_NNN_short_title.md` where NNN is the next available number
3. Fill in all sections of the template
4. Add the debt item to this registry in all relevant sections
5. Ensure the appropriate stakeholders are aware of the new debt item

### Updating Technical Debt Status

When a debt item's status changes:

1. Update the debt item document with the new status and any progress
2. Update this registry to reflect any changes in priority or categorization
3. If the debt has been fully addressed, move it to the "Addressed Debt" section with the date resolved

### Addressed Technical Debt

This section tracks debt items that have been fully addressed, serving as a record of improvements and learning opportunities.
