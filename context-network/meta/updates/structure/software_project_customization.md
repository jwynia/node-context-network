# Software Project Context Network Customization

## Purpose
This document records the customization of the generic context network template for software development projects with LLM management and navigation capabilities.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Structure
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Update Details

### Summary
Customized the generic context network template to create a specialized version for software development projects. This customization includes software-specific structure, templates, and navigation patterns designed to address the unique knowledge management challenges of software development.

### Motivation
Software development projects face unique knowledge management challenges: code evolves rapidly, technical decisions have long-lasting impacts, team knowledge is often implicit, and the gap between "how we built it" and "what we built" creates dangerous knowledge silos. A specialized context network structure helps address these challenges.

### Changes Made

#### Foundation Layer Updates
- Updated `project_definition.md` with software-specific purpose, goals, and scope
- Updated `principles.md` with software development principles including separation of concerns, cognitive load management, temporal awareness, multi-perspective documentation, and living documentation
- Updated `structure.md` with software-specific structure overview and key elements
- Added `system_overview.md` template for documenting high-level software system descriptions

#### New Specialized Layers
- Added `architecture/` directory for system architecture documentation
- Added `architecture/component_map.md` for documenting component relationships
- Added `evolution/` directory for tracking system changes over time
- Added `evolution/technical_debt_registry.md` for tracking technical debt
- Added `cross_cutting/` directory for cross-cutting concerns
- Added `cross_cutting/api_design_guide.md` for API design standards

#### New Templates
- Added `meta/templates/adr_template.md` for Architecture Decision Records
- Added `meta/templates/component_template.md` for component documentation
- Added `meta/templates/technical_debt_template.md` for technical debt items

#### Navigation Updates
- Updated `discovery.md` with software-specific navigation paths for different roles and tasks
- Added software-specific classification dimensions including lifecycle stage and audience

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated `.context-network.md` discovery file with software-specific purpose and guidelines
- Updated `README.md` with software project context network description and benefits

### Impact
These changes transform the generic context network into a specialized tool for software development projects, providing:

1. Clear separation between planning artifacts (context network) and implementation artifacts (codebase)
2. Structured approach to documenting architecture decisions with context and rationale
3. Component documentation patterns that capture responsibilities and interfaces
4. Technical debt tracking with impact assessment and remediation plans
5. Role-specific navigation paths for different stakeholders
6. Software-specific classification system for better information organization

### Next Steps
1. Create additional templates for software-specific documentation needs
2. Develop example ADRs to demonstrate the decision documentation process
3. Create process documentation for development, testing, and deployment workflows
4. Implement code-documentation synchronization strategies
